Game Engines Project

My game is a simple platformer with a level editor so the player can create their own levels.

I referred to previous labs and lectures for the DLL and design pattern portions
of the project, the level editor stuff was done from scratch, as well as the art.
The dirty flag implementation was referred from both the lab, and previous 
experience using them.
